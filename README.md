# piglatiniser
This is a very quick experiment I made with Javascript to create an application that could translate any language in Piglatin.

Please feel free to use, alter, modify and play with it. I created it in an hour just as an experiment so use it as a skeleton to do a lot better!

This is actually my first redepositary on GitHub!
